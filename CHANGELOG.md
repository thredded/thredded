  [#791](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/791)

# v0.16.7

## Fixed

* Fix post order for moderation pending & activity (a regression introduced in v0.16.6).
  [cec880d8](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/commit/cec880d898ed0e35dda2e94de2e0e1bd09a1ce6d)

# v0.16.6

## Fixed

* N+1 queries moderation pending & activity.

  This also fixes ActiveRecord pool exhaustion caused by trying to obtain multiple database connections
  from the render threads.
  [#788](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/788)

# v0.16.5

## Fixed

* Kramdown v2.0 support.
  [#786](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/786)

# v0.16.4

## Changed

* Previously, Thredded issued a separate database query for @-mentions within each post when rendering a topic
  (at most 1 query per topic). Since posts are rendered in multiple threads by default, this wasn't as slow as
  you might expect. However, it still required a larger connection pool and could still be slow for topics with
  lots of @-mentions. Now, Thredded caches the @-mentioned users and the database query is under a mutex.
  This means Thredded no longer needs a large database connection pool ([#770](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/770))
  and queries for repeated @-mentions across posts are avoided.

  [#771](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/771)

# v0.16.3

Fixes private topic form preview (regression in v0.16.2).

# v0.16.2

## Added

* `mark_as_read` and `mark_as_unread` endpoints can now also respond to JSON.
  This is intended for plugins and user extensions.
  [#763](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/763)

* A view hook for customizing topic title on `topics#show`.
  [#775](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/775)

## Changed

* `mark_as_read` and `mark_as_unread` are now the `/action/` route path scope (and so will all the future actions).
  [#763](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/763)

  Due to the new `/action` scope, if you have a Messageboard called "Action" you may need to change its slug:

  ```ruby
  Thredded::Messageboard.where(slug: 'action').each{|m| m.update(slug: 'action-messageboard')}
  ```

* Thredded now depends on [`sassc-rails`] instead of [`sass-rails`].
  [`sassc-rails`] uses [`sassc`], which is a wrapper for [`libsass`], a C++ implementation of Sass.
  This change was made because the Ruby implementation of Sass is now deprecated.
  [#736](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/736)

* Improved pt-BR translation. Thanks @wenderjean! [#766](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/766)

  [#759](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/759)

# v0.16.0

## Added

  [#735](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/735)

## Changed

* Thredded no longer provides emoji functionality such as `:smile:` by default, and also
  no longer depends on the `gemoji` gem. It is easy to add `gemoji` back in if you want to:

  1. Follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/github/gemoji.
  2. Add the following line to `config/initializers/thredded.rb`:

     ```ruby
     Thredded::ContentFormatter.after_markup_filters.insert(1, HTML::Pipeline::EmojiFilter)
     ```

See the full list of changes here: https://github.com/thredded/thredded/compare/v0.13.1...v0.13.2.

# v0.13.1

This is a minor bugfix release.

# v0.13.0

This release removes jQuery dependency from Thredded JavaScripts, reducing the size of the Thredded JavaScript bundle
from 67 KiB to 22 KiB gzipped.

## Changed

[textcomplete]: https://github.com/yuku-t/textcomplete

# v0.12.4

This release adds the ability to tell Thredded with version of Rails UJS to use.
Since Rails v5.1, the default is `rails-ujs` but Thredded for now still uses `jquery_ujs` by default.
This will change in Thredded v0.13.

If you'd like to tell Thredded to use `rails-ujs` now, update to this release and run the following command
from your app directory:

```bash
mkdir -p app/assets/javascripts/thredded/dependencies/
echo '//= require rails-ujs' > app/assets/javascripts/thredded/dependencies/ujs.js
```

  [#420](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/420)

## Fixed

* Multiple UX issues, including:

See the full list of changes here: https://github.com/thredded/thredded/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0.

# v0.7.0

This release contains new functionality and backwards-incompatible changes.

**NB:** If updating to this version from 0.6.x, you will need to copy and run [this migration](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/blob/1aba2433d7df1bd00478dd156d8f2526d36aad55/db/upgrade_migrations/20160723012349_upgrade_v0_6_to_v0_7.rb) after upgrading the gem.

## Added

* Messageboard ordering is now configurable. Three options are provided:
  * `position`: (default) set the position manually via the `position` column which defaults to the creation order,
     newly created messageboards got to the bottom.
  * `last_post_at_desc`: messageboards with most recent posts first.
  * `topics_count_desc`: messageboards with most topics first (previous default).
  Messageboard groups are now ordered by the new `position` column which also defaults to the creation order.
  [#404](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/404)
* The users that follow a topic can now be displayed on the topic page. This is controlled by a configuration option
  and is off by default. [#392](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/392)

## Changed

* Messageboard group name uniqueness is now enforced. If you had non-unique names before, the upgrade migration will
  deduplicate them. If you need to maintain previous behaviour, you can use
  [this workaround](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/318#issuecomment-242944339).
  [#318](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/318)
* Messageboards ordering now defaults to the order they were created in (previously: topics count).
  [#404](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/404)
* The read topics in the topics list are now also distinguished from the unread ones by their font weight.
  [#394](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/394)
* Following / not following indicators are now displayed on the topics list. The "following" icon ![Follow icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/thredded/thredded/img/follow.png) is displayed on
  the topic page if the topic is being followed by the user.
  [#394](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/394)

## Fixed

* Last topic tracking in messageboards now correctly reflects the topic when one is deleted.
  [#403](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/pull/403)
* Last post tracking in topics now always correctly reflects the last post and its timestamp. New `last_post_at` columns
  have been added to `topics` and `private_topics` to enable this.
  [#405](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/405)
* Thredded now uses the new `User#thredded_display_name` method for displaying the user's name in links.
  Previously, Thredded used `User#to_s`. This new method uses `Thredded.user_name_column` by default,
  simplifying the setup. [#398](https://github.com/thredded/thredded/issues/398)

## TLDR

## Added

* Full-text search abstracted out to gem (db_text_search) thanks to @glebm
* Rack-mini-profiler added to dummy app

## Changed

* Rails depedency bumped up to raisl 4.1+

##

# 0.1.0 - 2015-06-29

## Added

* Rake task to spin up a web server using the dummy application
* Rake task to assign user to a superadmin role
* A relatively large effort was put in effect for 0.1.0 to provide more thorough support for themes, new css and design, a small bit of javascript.
* Views have had a nice overhaul.
* Provide a generator that installs the default theme and integrates the associated css framework (if necessary). In the first theme we're using bourbon and neat. In the future - probably including foundation and bootstrap.
* Add a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to aid in getting a fully working instance of the thredded dummy app up and running.
* Instead of having a messageboard "setup" controller that is only available on the first run of the gem, move it over to `messageboards#new`.

## Changed

* Instead of creating a messageboard only once, allow superadmins to create new messageboards whenever through the messageboards resource.
* Use Puma instead of Webrick for the dev server
* Oft-used form elements (topics, posts) use the required html attribute.

## Fixed

* Remove Gemfile.lock from the repo
* Active users now shows the current user in addition to everyone else on the first (without having to refresh).


# 0.0.14

## Changed

* Until this release PrivateTopic inherited from Topic and used STI to reuse that table. Over time this led to some intermingling of concerns and more than the occasional shotgun surgery. As of now the Topic class has been split into Topic AND PrivateTopic, each with their own table.
* Provide means to display, or inspect, the unread private topics count. This now allows us to see if there are any private topics that one has not read.
* Add queue support for multiple background job libraries using the Q gem. Previous to now the only instances where we really cared about shoving something in the background was when we sent out mail - this is a bit myopic. There are several cases where some processes could/should be put into the background - hence needing a queue. The explicit requirement of a specific queue library is something we should avoid so the Q gem was pulled in to provide the abstraction layer that allows one of several libraries to be used - resque, sidekiq, delayed_job, or, the default, an in-memory threaded queue.
* Update rails dependency from `'~> 4.0.0'` to `'>= 4.0.0'`
* Replace nested forms with form objects
* Remove unused columns in tables - `state` from `thredded_topics`.
* Link to user from post on topic page (thanks @taylorkearns!)

## Fixed

* Fix issue where post did not inherit the test filter set per messagebard
* Building a new post for reply form must use the parent messageboard filter

# 0.0.13

## Fixed

* Users' messageboard preferences are created if one does not exist for a given messageboard. This had caused people who had not updated their own preferences to NOT receive @ notifications by default. As of this release they will, by default, receive @'s and private thread notifications until they change their preferences.

## Changed

* A topic's categories can now be rendered in the view. `categories/category` partial addded.
* Adding attachments to a post has been removed. (Attachment model and association will be removed in 0.0.15)

# 0.0.12

## Fixed

* Requiring the sql search builder explicitly fixes the issue where anonymous visitors would not be able to search
* Users, when they edit a topic they started, should not be able to pin/lock it. This has been changed to only allow admins to do so.
* bbcode now renders line-breaks
* html is now better sanitized

## Changed

* Replace the previously used inheritance-based filter chain with
[html-pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline). Much better.
* Replace bb-ruby with bbcoder gem.
* Replace `redcarpet` with `github-markdown`
* Provide a more explicit contract between the gem and the parent application with regards to the layout the thredded views will render within
* `:thredded_page_title` and `:thredded_page_id` provided as content blocks that may be yielded to the layout
* Allow gravatar image to be overridden in the config
* Thredded::PostDecorator#user_link now available for use in post-related views

# 0.0.11

## Feature / Bug Fix

* Up until now the manner by which file uploads (via Carrierwave) had its storage
location determined was in the uploaded classes themselves. This commit allows the
location to be set from the Thredded module itself - `Thredded.file_storage` - to
either :file or :fog.

# 0.0.10

* Make that `topic` method pass along to an obviously named and intention revealing method
* Delete the filter select from `posts/_form` partial

* Introduce `NullTopic` to stand in for instances where a topic is not found
* remove `rspec/autorun` from `spec_helper`
